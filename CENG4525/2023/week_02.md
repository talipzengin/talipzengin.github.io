```

### Learning objectives

The goal of this course is to introduce concepts of bioinformatics and modern scientific methods. Students completing the course should be able to:

* Understand basic biological mechanisms and features of biological data.
* Understand common problems of biology and possible solutions through computer science.
* Read, write, and modify computer code in the Python language for biological data.
* Understand the ideas behind the different bioinformatics algorithms.
* Design, implement, and debug scripts to perform bio-computational tasks.
* Model biological systems in a computational framework, and gain biological insights from those models in areas such as genetics, evolution, biochemistry and structural biology.
